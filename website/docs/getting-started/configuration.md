# Configuration

CastKeeper is configured using a YAML config file (`castkeeper.yml`),
environment variables, or a mixture of both.

## Config files

Config files are loaded by the CastKeeper server when it starts - either
from a path specified when starting the server, or from the default CastKeeper
config path. Only the first config file found is loaded, following this order:

1. The path specified as an argument when running the CastKeeper server, e.g.
   `castkeeper serve --config /path/to/my/castkeeper.yml`
2. `./castkeeper.yml` - in the current working directory where the CastKeeper
   server was started.
3. `/etc/castkeeper/castkeeper.yml`

### Example config file

```YAML
EnvName: prod
LogLevel: warn
BaseURL: https://castkeeper.example.com
DataPath: /app/data

WebServer:
  Port: 8080

ObjectStorage:
  Driver: awss3
  S3Bucket: my-castkeeper-bucket
  S3Prefix: podcasts/
```

## Environment variables

Every CastKeeper config option can alternatively be specified as an
environment variable.

The names of environment variables follow a convention:

- the config file option `EnvName` would become `CASTKEEPER_ENVNAME`.
- the nested config file option `WebServer.Port` would become `CASTKEEPER_WEBSERVER_PORT`

See the reference table below for the full list of environment variables.
