# CastKeeper

CastKeeper is a free application for archiving podcasts. It is designed to be
easy to self-host, published as a Docker container. It supports a variety of
file storage options.

CastKeeper was built primarily to do 2 things:

1. Store copies of podcasts, safe from being taken offline or being modified
   (e.g. due to abandonment or editorial changes), allowing for future
   re-listening.
2. Transcribe and index the text content of those podcasts, allowing
   searching for when certain topics were discussed (coming very soon in a
   future release).
