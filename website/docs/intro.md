# Introduction

CastKeeper is a free application for archiving podcasts. It is designed to be
easy to self-host, using either Docker or a self-contained executable. It
supports a variety of file storage options.

CastKeeper was built primarily to do 2 things I wanted:

1. Store copies of podcasts I listen to, safe from being taken offline or
   being modified (e.g. due to being abandoned or censored), allowing me to
   re-listen to them in future.
2. Transcribe and index the text content of those podcasts, allowing me to
   search for when certain topics were discussed (coming very soon in a
   future release).
