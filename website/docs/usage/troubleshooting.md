# Troubleshooting

## Logging

CastKeeper logs detailed information to stdout - this is the first place to
look when faced with a problem.

The log level can be set to `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` - the `info`
level is recommended as, although being verbose, CastKeeper is in early
development.

## Reporting issues

Please use GitHub issues to
[report issues](https://github.com/webbgeorge/castkeeper/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
