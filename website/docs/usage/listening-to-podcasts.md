# Listening to Podcasts

There are several ways to listen to podcasts once they are in CastKeeper.

## CastKeeper feed

CastKeeper creates a feed for every podcast. The content of this feed is the
same as the original feed, but the content is served directly from CastKeeper.

The CastKeeper feed URL for a podcast is displayed on it's view podcast page.
This URL can be used with your podcast player of choice - noting that this feed
is authenticated using your CastKeeper username and password, and the URL for
CastKeeper will need to be accessible to the podcast player.

## Download episode

Individual episodes can be downloaded from the CastKeeper web UI, by clicking
download next to the episode in the list.

## Web player

Coming soon.
